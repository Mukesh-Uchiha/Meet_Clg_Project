# MEET College project

A real time messaging & video calling. Youtube tutorial will be upload in the comming days.

This project proposes an innovative approach to address the communication challenges faced by individuals with impaired hearing during video conferencing. The purpose is to improve the accessibility and inclusivity of virtual communication platforms by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Closed Captioning (CC) functionalities. The proposed system employs advanced NLP algorithms to enhance real-time speech recognition and language understanding, catering specifically to the nuances of diverse accents, speech patterns, and contextual cues. By leveraging these capabilities, the system aims to provide accurate and contextually relevant transcriptions of spoken content within the video conferencing environment. In addition to the NLP-driven transcription, the research focuses on the integration of dynamic Closed Captioning to generate synchronized, visually accessible text longside the video feed. This feature ensures that participants with impaired earing can follow the conversation more effectively, capturing not only spoken words but also nonverbal cues, enhancing the overall communication experience.
